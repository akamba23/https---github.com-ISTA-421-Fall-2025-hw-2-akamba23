Question 1
a. The sample size (number of observations; n) is extremely large, and the number of
predictors (features; p) is small.

ANSWER: The flexible statistical learning is probably better because it doesn't have a lot of features, along with the

b. The number of predictors (p) is extremely large, and the number of observations (n) is
small.

ANSWER: The inflexible statistical learning is better because a lot of features and not many data would make
it much easier for the data to overfit.

c. The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.
